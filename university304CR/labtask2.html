					<h3>How I think Unity's algorithm is working</h3>
					<p>
						First there is the generation of the Navigaton Mesh (NavMesh), which hold the data of the walkable areas inside
						the game scene. Then from the resulted polygons from the generation of the navigation map, the Movable AI Objects (Agents),
						are then calculating the path using the edges of the navigation map, towards the end location that was set as being the targeted
						destination.
					</p>

							<p class="align-center">Fig 1. Navigation map and Collision Avoid Detection</p>
						</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<br/>
				<div>
					<h3>What do I think the performance factors are</h3>
					<p>
						If you have a simple game where only one agent moves in the scene, it is fine to find all the corners and animate the character
						to move along the edges that were calculated that connects the agent to the destination.
					</p>
					<div class="12u(small) 6u m-auto">
						<span class="image fit">
							<img src="../images/university304CR/lab-task2/image-0003.jpg" alt="main-zombietutorial" />
							<p class="align-center">Fig 2. Navigation map and Collision Avoid Detection</p>
						</span>
					</div>
					<p>
						The problem appears when dealing with multiple agents moving at the same time, they will need to deviate from the original path when avoiding 
						each other. Trying to correct such deviations using a path consisting of edges it becomes unreliable very quickly.
						Also, the more agents that have to calculate a different path, the more computations per frame, which results in a very poor performance.
						This most of the time results in slowing down the whole game, which in an Open World game like a RPG, is very probable and has been attempted to be fixed,
						by calculating patrolling paths only for agents that are in the view of the player.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Cases where I think AI might struggle</h3>
					<p>
						The AI overall is a series of commands that have been predetermined by the developers. Without Machine Learning and Neural Networks, the AI in games can 
						be so much of a challange that the developers want it to be. As it is something that a person has developed, and not a computer, there can be errors that
						appear, which shows that something predetermined can't be flawless, bugs appearing and exploits being found by the players are something very common these days.
					</p>
					<p>
						But in the end, this is was Games are developed around of, if the AI was perfect and unbeatable, then no one would play that specific game. The sole purpose of games
						is to have an end, to give a feeling of achievement to the player.
