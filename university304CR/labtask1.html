					<h1>Lab task - Week 1</h1>
				</header>
				<div>
					<p>
						For this weeks lab, we had to firstly had to download and install a couple of demos which display 
						different AI behaviours of which we had to analyse and discuss based on our findings.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h3>Body Guard AI</h3>
					<p>
						What I noticed while I was checking out the Body Guard AI Demo was that while I was moving the main player,
						all the other AI Controllers were trying to cover as many angles as possible. Even though they were trying to cover as many angles,
						they were also allowing the player to cover some parts of the FOV, as the main purpose of the demo wasn't to completely guard the player,
						but also allow the player to find tactics in order to defend himself.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="12u(small) 6u m-auto">
					<span class="image fit">
						<img src="../images/university304CR/lab-task1/image0001.jpg" alt="main-bodyguardai-0001" />
						<p class="align-center">Fig 1. Screenshot of the body guard AI game</p>
					</span>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						While they were covering the player, they were getting a specific set of points in their FOV, that they should be checking at all times.
						Those points, were never overlapping with other AIs' checking points, so that they would never cover the same position, getting a larger
						area of effect while covering the player. If they were to get in a narrow position, what I noticed was that they were trying to not hold,
						positions facing the wall, but were trying to find larger openings, which led me to think that they had a minimum disarable distance that
						they had to meet in their AI.
					</p>
				</div>

				<br/>
				<div>
					<h3>Predator Prey AI</h3>
					<p>
						What I noticed while I was checking out the Predator prey AI was that in most of the cases, the Predator AI was waiting on the 
						Prey AI to bundle together, so that it would have more chances to catch a prey.
						While doing so, the Prey itself, was trying to take advantage of the other Preys, so that it would cut the distance between the Predator
						and himself, by bringing another prey between them. This way the Predator would focus on the closest Prey, trying to increase its chances
						of catching something. If there weren't any suitable grouping of Preys, the Predator was waiting until there was a case that would
						help it catch more Pteys.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="12u(small) 6u m-auto">
					<span class="image fit">
						<img src="../images/university304CR/lab-task1/image0002.jpg" alt="main-predatorprey-0002" />
						<p class="align-center">Fig 2. Screenshot of the Predator Prey AI game</p>
					</span>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						The Predator wouldn't be chansing the Prey endlesly. Having a threshold of how much time it would try to catch the Prey.
						After that threshold being overpassed, it would give up and wait for better chances.
					</p>
				</div>

				<br/>
				<div>
					<h3>Watching the video given</h3>
					<p>
						What I learned watching the video <i>What Makes Good AI? | Game Maker's Toolkit</i>, was that it is very easy to forget what the actual purpose of
						an AI is. Which in this case, the main purpose of an AI is to allow the player to win, by improving the gameplay and the immersion using AIs
						and enemies that will act in various ways.
						I also learned that an AI, should also act in a predictable manner. This is because, the player should be engaged in planning and coming up with ideas
						of how it should aproach a certain situation.

					</p>
				</div>

				<br/>
				<div>
					<h3>Extra research</h3>
					<p>
						There is a term given by philosophers and psychologist which is called Theory of Mind. This represents the cognitive function which in most games 
						it can either go very wrong or very bad when it comes to AI. The Theory of Mind is what make someone to believe what other people are thinking, 
						this way giving us the understanding of the different perceptions of the same person.
					</p>
					<p>
						The best examples of poor Theory of Mind implementation is Borderlands. Every time when you shot an enemy, all enemies that are in a specific radius 
						from the target that has been alarmed, will be attacking you as well. Which I think it doesn't fit a what we should call a good AI implemention, or 
						smart AI. But it fits the purpose for that specific game. 
					</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, games like Hitman, which the AI needs to fullfil the Stealth | Strategy type of game, they typically need to manage the Theory of Mind
						bettern than other games. This is because the main mechanic of that genre is to involve coming up with solutions to problems by confusing the enemy, which
						required rules to separate the thinking of each individual member of the oposing force.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are also games in which the AI improves, changes and is getting altered based on what actions the player has taken, so that it makes it more 
						diverse making the player to find new strategies all the time. Like in FEAR where the AI can notice the flashlights, they use ordinary objects as cover,
						they toss grenades when you are in a tight area, they fake death and so on.
