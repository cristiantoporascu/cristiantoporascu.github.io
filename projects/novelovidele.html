				<p>
					Novelo and Videle are two platforms that I developed as a freelancer for ENCORSA. These two platforms were built
					in .NET CORE, with databases in MySQL. During the development process I had to discuss with various clients and
					inverstors to plan and discuss a timeframe in which the project is going to be developed.
				</p>
				<h4>What I learned</h4>
				<p>
					During the development of the Videle Web App, I learned how to make a CMS (Content Management System) from scratch.
					This was very helpful as a way to improve myself as a programmer and as a Web Developer, because I learned how
					the data has to be filtered, transfered, and monitored between various interactions from multiple users at the same time.
					I learned how certain parts of the data from the database can be locked and unlocked, depending on the number of 
					processes that are going on at that point.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the development of the Novelo Web App, I learned how to recognise information from sentences asynchronously and 
					submit that data to the OCR (Optical Character Recognision) package from google. This Was returning a JSON which then I 
					I was parsing into data that was provided later on with a screenshot to the customers.
