				<p>
					This project was developed for a project that was undergone during the 3rd of the 
					Games Technology course at Coventry University, and it achieved a score of 92.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project was aigmed to give the opportunity to develop a real-time raytracer using
					computer graphics algorithms and techniques based purely in C++.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ray tracer is meant to be written from scratch, and to be able to run as close to real-time
					performance as possible. Ray tracis is one of the techniques that allow the generation of images (frames)
					by tracing rays from the camera (viewer) towards the objects and bouncing the ray towards the path of light.
					After calculating the colour based on the path and the virtual boejcts crossed during the travel of the ray,
					it returns a colour and its effects to simulate an image on a plane.
				</p>
				<p>
					The window that the calculations are generated on is build using SDL as the main API.
					The generation is supported by multi-threading and segmentation for faster render rate.
					Octrees have been implemented based on the bounding boxes of a set object, which helps to check the intersection of the
					ray with only one set of triangles and not all of the topolgies at once.
